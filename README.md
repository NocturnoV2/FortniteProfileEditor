# Fortnite Profile Editor (Temporary Name)

With this tool, you can easily edit any profile you want and view information which is contained in your profile. Brought to you by the Team behind Project Nocturno!

## Planned Features:
  * Load and save profiles such as profile0, campaign, athena, metadata, theater0, etc.
  * Add Tabs for Outfits in a profile (profile0, athena) and Heroes (profile0, campaign)
  * Add the ability to add an ID to any profile and add any desired attributes to it.
  * Edit a Theater file from STW (change zone name, power level, missions, hex coordinates, etc)
  * having an easy to navigate GUI.

## AS OF NOW, THERE IS LITTLE TO NO FUNCTIONALITY. The GUI is also very barebones as of now but that will change in the future. If you would like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request!
